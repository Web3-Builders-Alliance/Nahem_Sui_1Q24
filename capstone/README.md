The plan is to make a Decentralised Asset Management Marketplace.

- Strategists (traders, asset managers, VCs, banks, degens, etc) can create their strategies in a permissionless / decentralized way.  
- A deposit might be needed on strategy creation to start collecting metrics, prevent spam, think of PoS also.
- There will be some metrics to evaluate strategy performances (TVL, volume, P&L, risk, drawdown, Sharp / Sortino ratio, amount of trades, time since genesis, cathegory, etc).
- Users (usually without any trading experience, time, consistent skills, risk management experience, etc) can filter and deposit into a strategy based on their needs / goals; and withdraw at any time (permissionless too).
- Strategists earn some % on profits (taken on user withdrawals) but if a strategy is losing money, users can exit at zero cost (no fee taken by strategist).

A strategy could be made using on-chain or off-chain computation to trigger actions but must be executed fully on-chain.
Protorev: fees from strategists on strategy creation, fees from users on withdrawals, website ads.

Imagine a strategy as a dynamic ETF where the strategist can choose at any time what to buy/sell, rebalance asset allocation, keep some stable coin balance available to buy the dip, etc. Assets can be yield bearing assets (liquid staked tokens, lending token receipts, LPs, etc), tokens, wrapped tokens, stablecoins, NFTs, RWA, you name it (as long as they're liquid). 

Could be also similar to copy trading in web2 (eToro, Binance, Darwinex)
